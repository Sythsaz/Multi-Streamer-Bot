<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Automates the release process for versioned releases.

.PARAMETER Version
    The version to release (e.g., "1.5.8").

.PARAMETER DryRun
    Simulates the release process without making any changes.

.PARAMETER SkipSafetyChecks
    Bypasses git status, branch, and secrets checks.

.PARAMETER FinalizeOnly
    Skips PR creation and jumps straight to tagging.
    Use this when you've manually created and merged a release PR.

.EXAMPLE
    # Full workflow: create PR, wait for merge, then tag
    .\tools\auto-release.ps1 -Version 1.5.8

.EXAMPLE
    # Finalize only: PR already merged, just tag the release
    .\tools\auto-release.ps1 -Version 1.5.8 -FinalizeOnly
#>
